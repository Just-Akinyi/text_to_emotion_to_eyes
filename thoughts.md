    -------------NOT ACCURATE-----------------
    First way -> split sentence to words
                get emotion of each word
                append an eye and brow on it

    Limitation: some words have no emotions
                    great - happy -> has emotion
                    wow - surprised -> has emotion
                    how - NO EMOTION
                    hi - no emotion

    -------------MORE ACCURATE----------------
    Second way -> get the whole podcast
                get a sentence (split by , and .)
                read its emotions
                append an eye and a brow

    Limitations: -> doubled up emotions
                 -> we'll need to filter not
                        not happy --> 'sad'
                        not bad --> 'happy'
